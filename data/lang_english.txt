; the script ignores lines that start with a semicolon
; this lang_english text-file can be used as a template to create new language-files
; feel free to publish your translation files in the Lailloken UI discussions section or your own GitHub repository
; I kindly ask you not to publish them as part of a Lailloken UI fork (imho, a translation for which I have laid the groundwork does not warrant a separate fork)

; make a __COPY__ of this file, then rename the __COPY__ to lang_XYZ (XYZ will be displayed in the drop-down menu in the <general> section of the settings menu, and it will also be used as a suffix for other required files, e.g. Betrayal-info data)
; the next time you restart the script, there should be a drop-down list with languages in the <general> section of the settings menu
; I know enough German to supply some edge-case examples/requirements for syntax-structures that differ from English, but not enough to add complete support for German game-clients
; use these examples to adjust the language-file to your own language

; each line of the main data is divided into two parts:
;		key		=	"value"

; __DO NOT__ edit the key of a line, i.e. whatever is left of the equal sign
; always use TABs wherever this sample file uses them: if preferred, you can also remove them, but __DO NOT__ replace them with simple spaces

; the value contains in-game text AS IT IS DISPLAYED IN THE CHAT-BOX, and that's also what the script is looking for in the client.txt log-file
; the value has to be enclosed in quotation marks, and it is also case-sensitive
; to leave a value blank, set it to "0"

; depending on the syntax of a language, info-extraction from the client.txt file has to be adjusted
; generally, the script looks for certain patterns to determine what kind of information is present within a line in the log-file
; for English, "You have entered Highgate." will be displayed whenever you enter Highgate
; the script recognizes "You have entered", then 'knows' that the rest of the sentence is the location-name (so white-space and everything else will be removed)
; for German (and maybe others as well), "Ihr habt 'Hohenpforte' betreten." will be displayed
; so the script has to look for "Ihr habt" and "betreten" instead, then remove them to extract the location-name

; to let the script 'know' of this structural difference, additional key/value pairs have to be provided
; simply add one or more additional line(s) with the same key: it's important to list them in the correct order, i.e. following the sentence structure
;		enter			=	"Ihr habt"
;		enter			=	"betreten"
