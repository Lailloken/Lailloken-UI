;## general information/instructions
;#####################################################

;## purpose of this file
	;## the script uses this file to detect specific word patterns in data that was copied from the game-client in order to extract information
	;## these patterns used to be hard-coded for English only, but they are now exposed in this txt-file and can be adapted to new target languages


;## file structure
	;## the script ignores TABs, empty lines, as well as lines/sections marked as comments (;##)
	;## each non-comment line in this file is a key/value pair, divided into two parts:
		;##	key			=	"value"
		;## the value has to be enclosed in quotation marks
		;## the value itself can still contain quotation marks, e.g. key = "Guff "Tiny" Grenn" (just make sure the total number of quotation marks is even)
		;## to leave a value blank, set it to "0" (there will be examples of this further below)


;## how to translate/localize the data in this file
	;## NEVER edit the key of a line, i.e. whatever is left of the equal sign
	;## if a value contains an abbreviation or text-string that's not immediately clear, look at the key-name for more context (e.g. global_calibrate = "cal")
	;## the majority of values in this file are text-strings as they are displayed in game, so you'll have to replace them with the ones from the target language


;## some notation remarks
	;## AutoHotkey-specific:
		;## in order to add ampersands (&) to a string, include double ampersands in the value, e.g. key = "this && that"
	;## custom notations:
		;## in order to add line-breaks to a string, include ";" in the value, e.g. "line 1;line2"
		;## I use "<>" as a replacement for quotation marks because they look better when using Fontin Smallcaps


;## syntax differences
	;## depending on the target language, info-extraction from the game-client has to be adjusted
	;## generally, the script looks for certain patterns to determine what kind of information is present within the data copied from the client
	;## I know enough German to supply some edge-case examples/requirements for syntax-structures that differ from English, but not enough to add complete support for German game-clients
	;## use these examples to adjust the language-file to your own language:

	;## with an English client, "You have entered Highgate." will be displayed whenever you enter Highgate
		;## the script uses this key-value pair to extract the location-name from the text in the chat-window:
		;## 		log_enter	=	"You have entered"
		;## the script recognizes "You have entered", then 'knows' that the rest of the sentence is the location-name (so white-space and everything else will be removed)

	;## with a German client, "Ihr habt 'Hohenpforte' betreten." will be displayed instead
		;## so the script has to look for "Ihr habt" and "betreten" instead, then remove them to extract the location-name
		;## to let the script 'know' of this structural difference, placeholders have to be included in the value
		;## simply add one or more placeholders in the correct spots:
		;##		log_enter	=	"Ihr habt # betreten"
